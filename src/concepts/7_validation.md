# 07. Validation: Assuring Data Integrity

<div class="coreconcepts-intro" markdown="1">
Holochain DNAs specify **validation rules** for every type of entry or link. This empowers end-users to **check the integrity** of the data they see. When called upon to validate data, it allows them to identify corrupt peers and publish a **warrant** against them.

## Validation: the beating heart of Holochain

Let's review what we've covered so far.

1. Holochain is a framework for building apps that let peers directly share data without needing the protective oversight of a central server.
2. How does it do this? You may recall from [the beginning](../1_the_basics) of this series that Holochain's two pillars are **intrinsic data integrity** and **peer replication/validation**. The first pillar defines what valid data looks like while the second pillar uses the rules of the first pillar to protect users and the whole network.
3. We said that each type of [**app entry**](../3_source_chain#source-chain-your-own-data-store) can contain any sort of string data whose correctness is determined by custom **validation rules**.
4. We then showed how [**peer validators**](../4_dht#a-cloud-of-witnesses) use those rules to analyze entries and spread the news about bad actors.

Holochain is the engine that moves data around, validates it, and takes action based on validation results. Your DNA is simply a collection of functions for creating data and validation rules for checking that data. Those two things are critical to the success of your app because they define the membranes of safety between the user and DHT. Well designed validation rules protect everyone, while buggy validation rules leave them vulnerable.

Some entries can be computationally expensive to validate. In a currency app, for example, the validity of a transaction rests on the account balances of both transacting parties, which is the sum of all their prior transactions. The validity of each of those transactions depends on the account balance at the time, plus the validity of the account balance of the people with whom they transacted, and so on and so on. The data is deeply interconnected; it could take forever to call up every single transaction and validate it, which is inconvenient when all you want to do is buy a cup of coffee and get to work.

The DHT offers a shortcut---it remembers the validation results of existing entries. You can ask the validators of the parties' previous transactions if they detected any problems. You can assume that they have done the same thing for the transaction prior to those and so on. As long as you trust a significant portion of your peers to be following the same rules as you, the validitation result of the most recent entry 'proves' the validity of all the entries before it.

## Validation flow: success and failure

A validation function returns either true or false, with an optional error description. It's called in two different scenarios, each with different consequences. We'll carry on with the [DHT illustrations from chapter 4](../4_dht/#a-cloud-of-witnesses), but let's add a simple validation rule: there's an entry of type `word` whose validation rule says that it can only contain one word.

### Authoring

When you **commit an entry**, your Holochain conductor is responsible for making sure you're playing by the rules. This protects you from publishing any invalid data that could make you look like a bad actor.

#### Valid entry

<div class="coreconcepts-storysequence" markdown="1">
1. ![](https://i.imgur.com/NjhKg36.png)
Alice calls the `publish_word` zome function with the string `"eggplant."` The function asks the conductor to `commit` it as an entry of type `word`.

2. ![](https://i.imgur.com/ArsWzay.png)
Alice's conductor calls the DNA's validation function for the `word` entry type.

3. ![](https://i.imgur.com/TRurEG5.png)
The validation function sees only one word, so the entry is valid. It returns `Ok`.

4. ![](https://i.imgur.com/TVNLuCA.png)
Her conductor commits the entry to her source chain, publishes it to the DHT, and returns the new entry's address to the waiting `publish_word` function.
</div>

#### Invalid entry

<div class="coreconcepts-storysequence" markdown="1">
1. ![](https://i.imgur.com/C1OF4DL.png)
Alice calls the same zome function with the string `"orca whales."` Again, the function calls `commit`.

2. ![](https://i.imgur.com/Bnd9cK6.png)
Again, the conductor calls the validation function for the `word` entry type.

3. ![](https://i.imgur.com/f86qKYD.png)
This time, the validation function sees two words. It returns an `Err` containing the message, `"Must contain only one word."`

4. ![](https://i.imgur.com/IgmJcRE.png)
Instead of committing the entry, the conductor only passes this error message back to the waiting zome function.
</div>

Author-side validation is similar to how data validation works in a traditional client/server app.

### Peer validation

When your node **receives an entry for validation**, the flow is very different. Your Holochain node doesn't just assume that the author has already validated the data; they could easily have hacked their conductor to bypass validation rules. It's your duty and right to treat every piece of data as suspect until you can personally verify it. Fortunately, you have your own copy of the validation rules.

Here are the two scenarios above from the perspective of the validators.

#### Valid entry

<div class="coreconcepts-storysequence" markdown="1">
1. ![](https://i.imgur.com/LsGvr5p.png)
Diana and Fred receive a copy of Alice's `"eggplant"` entry for validation and storage.

2. ![](https://i.imgur.com/9Q39LLn.png)
Their conductors call the `word` entry type's validation function.

3. ![](https://i.imgur.com/58TT8Uc.png)
The entry is valid, so they store it in their personal shard of the DHT, along with their **validation signatures** attesting its validity.

4. ![](https://i.imgur.com/WQUVXrp.png)
They both send a copy of their signatures back to Alice.
</div>

#### Invalid entry

Let's say Alice has taken off her guard rails---she's hacked her Holochain software to bypass the validation rules.

<div class="coreconcepts-storysequence" markdown="1">
1. ![](https://i.imgur.com/szHQCPs.png)
Norman and Rosie receive a copy of Alice's `"orca whales"` entry.

2. ![](https://i.imgur.com/wbp8O98.png)
Their conductors call the validation function.

3. ![](https://i.imgur.com/J5gnlut.png)
The entry is invalid. They create, sign, and store a **warrant** that contains the evidence (the invalid entry) along with their signatures.

4. ![](https://i.imgur.com/IttfF1u.png)
Norman and Rosie add Alice to their blacklists and share the warrant with their neighbors, who put her on _their_ blacklists and pass it on.

5. ![](https://i.imgur.com/pkmLBZ5.png)
Eventually, everyone knows that Alice is a 'bad actor' who has hacked her app. She is effectively ejected from the system.

## Use cases for validation

The purpose of validation is to **empower a group of individuals to hold one another accountable to a shared set of rules**. This is a pretty abstract claim, so let's break it down into a few categories. With validation rules, you can define:

* **Access membranes**---validation rules on the **agent ID entry** govern who's allowed to join a DNA's network and see its data.
* **The shape of valid data**---validation rules on **entry and link types that hold data** can check for properly structured data, upper/lower bounds on numbers, string lengths, non-empty fields, or correctly formatted content.
* **Rules of the game**---validation rules on **entry and links types that hold details about an action** can make sure chess moves, transactions, property transfers, and votes are legitimate.
* **Privileges**---validation rules on **[create](../4_dht), [update, or remove](../6_crud_operations) actions** on entries and links can define who gets to do what.

## How validation rules are defined

If you're using our [Rust HDK](https://developer.holochain.org/api/latest/hdk/), your validation rule for any entry or link type is simply a function that takes a string, analyzes it, and returns a result (`Ok` or error message).

If your entry holds structured data such as JSON, however, it's annoying to hand-roll your own parsing code so the HDK lets you declare a validation function to accept a [struct](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/custom_types/structs.html) of your own creation. If it sees this sort of function, it'll automatically assume that the entry content is JSON and try to deserialize it into an instance of that struct. If it can't make the conversion, validation fails before your function is even called. This lets you forget about the low-level details and work with your app's native types.

## Guidelines for writing validation rules

Validation functions **return a boolean value**, meant to be used as clear evidence that an agent has tampered with their Holochain software. This means they aren't appropriate for soft things, like codes of conduct, which usually require human approval. They should be [**deterministic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm) and [**pure**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) so that the result for a given commit doesn't change based on who validated it, when they validated it, or what new information was available to them at validation time.

Nothing can be invalidated once it's been published and validated, but just as with [updating or deleting entries](../6_crud_operations), you can write new data that supersedes existing data.

## Key takeaways

* Validation supports intrinsic data integrity, which upholds the security of a Holochain app.
* Validation rules are the most important part of a Holochain DNA, as they define the core domain logic that comprises the 'rules of the game.'
* Validation rules can cover an agent's entry into an application, the shape and content of data, rules for interaction, and write permissions.
* The result of a validation function is a clear yes/no result. It proves whether the author has hacked their software to produce invalid entries.
* If the validity of an entry depends on existing entries, existing validation results on that data can speed up the process.
* An author validates all their entries before committing the data to their source chain or publishing to the DHT.
* All public entries on the DHT are subject to third-party validation before they're stored. This validation uses the same rules that the author used at the time of commit.
* Validation rules are functions that analyze the content of an entry and return either a success or error message.
* When an entry is found to be invalid, the validator creates and shares a warrant, which proves that the author is writing corrupt data.
* Agents can use warrants as grounds for blocking communication with a corrupt agent.
* Validation functions should be deterministic and pure.
* An entry can't be found invalid once it's been validated, but new data can be produced to supersede obsolete data.

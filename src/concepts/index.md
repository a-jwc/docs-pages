# Holochain Core Concepts

Welcome to Holochain Core Concepts! Here we'll introduce you to the basics of Holochain, a framework and network protocol for building secure distributed applications. Holochain is different from what you may be used to, but we'll go at a comfortable pace, building on things you already know.

## Who is this introduction for?

We've written this introduction for programmers, CTOs, and other technically oriented people. It's a bit like a choose-your-own-adventure story.

**If you're in a hurry**, and want to find out if Holochain is a good fit for your project, you can just read the articles---or if you're in a real hurry, read the intro paragraph at the top and the key takeaways at the bottom.

**If you're a programmer** and want to see the concepts come to life, follow the [tutorials](../tutorials/coreconcepts/). Each tutorial is quick---you'll be creating a running app in anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. Code samples are written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

**If you want to dig deep**, each article has links to further reading from the guidebook, API documentation, or web.

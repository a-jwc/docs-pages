# Holochain Glossary

!!! info "WIP"
    This article is currently a work in progress and subject to frequent change.
    See [changelog](../changelog) for details.

As you go through our documentation you'll probably find some unfamiliar terms, or familiar ones used in surprising ways. Here are the definitions we use.

#### Address

The unique ID of an [entry](#entry) or [agent](#agent) on the [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht). Every entry has an address that is generated from its content, usually by a [hash](#hash) function.

#### Address space

The entire range of possible [addresses](#address) on the [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht). This space is circular; that is, the last address is considered adjacent to the first address.

#### Agency

The relative power of an [agent](#agent) to participate in their world.

#### Agent

1. Anything with [agency](#agency), such as a human or bot.

2. An agent (definition 1) who participates in a Holochain [network](#network) through their [DNA instance](#dna-instance).

3. The [public/private key pair](#public-key-cryptography) that represents an agent (definition 2).

#### Agent-centric

Describes a [distributed system](#distributed-system) that puts [agents](#agent) at the center of the design, giving them [agency](#agency) over their online identity and the data they create. Agent-centric systems are usually [distributed](#distributed-system) and use [public-key cryptography](#public-key-cryptography) to identify agents. [Git](https://git-scm.com), Holochain, and [Secure Scuttlebutt](https://scuttlebutt.nz) are highly agent-centric, while client/server systems are less so.

#### Agent address

The address of an [agent ID](#agent-id) entry on the [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht), calculated from the agent's [public key](#public-key-cryptography). It is used in [node-to-node messaging](#node-to-node-messaging) and in choosing [validators](#validator) for [public entries](#public-entry).

#### Agent ID

An [entry](#entry) near the beginning of an [agent](#agent)'s [source chain](#source-chain) that identifies them. It contains their [public key](#public-key-cryptography) and other identifying information. This entry becomes an agent's unique identifier in the app. The address of this entry is also the [agent's address](#agent-address) on the DHT.

#### Append-only

Describes any data structure that can only be written to. Once written, data is 'immutable', which means it can't be modified or deleted. An agent's [source chain](#source-chain) and the [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht) are both append-only, which makes them [logically monotonic](#logical-monotonicity).

#### Application (app)

Synonymous with [hApp](#holochain-application-happ).

#### Aspect

A piece of metadata on an entry, such as a [link](#link), [provenance](#provenance), [validation signature](#validation-signature), [warrant](#warrant), or [CRUD](#create-read-update-delete-crud) status.

#### Author

The [agent](#agent) who has [published](#publish) a [DHT entry](#dht-entry), as shown by their [provenance](#provenance).

#### Back end

Synonymous with a collection of [DNA instances](#dna-instance) for a [hApp](#holochain-application-happ)---the code that contains the base-level persistence and validation logic.

#### Blockchain

A distributed system that promises [Byzantine fault tolerance](#byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft) by using a [coordination protocol](#coordination-protocol) to get all nodes to agree on a single, shared history of events. This history is stored as a [hash chain](#hash-chain) of 'blocks', or bundles of [state transitions](#state-transition). A blockchain can be public (anyone can join) or permissioned/private (membership is controlled). Public blockchains are usually [trustless](#trustless), ensuring tamper-resistance by making cheating more costly than honesty.

#### Bridge

A connection between [DNA instances](#dna-instance) in one conductor that allows one instance to call another instance's [zome functions](#zome-function).

#### Bundle

1. A [hApp bundle](#happ-bundle).

2. A group of [commits](#commit) that succeed or fail 'atomically', like a transaction in an SQL database (not yet supported).

#### Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT)

Describes the ability of a [distributed system](#distributed-system) to reach [consistency](#consistency) in spite of 'Byzantine failures', accidental or intentional corruption in [nodes](#node) or the networking transport between them.

#### Capability-based security

A security model that allows the owner of a resource to grant others access while still maintaining ultimate control. Instead of allowing direct access to the resource, it mediates access and manages privileges by issuing 'capabilities'. In Holochain, an [agent](#agent)'s [conductor](#conductor) protects their running [DNA instances](#dna-instance) and authorizes [subjects](#capability-subject)' access to them by issuing and checking [tokens](#capability-token).

#### Capability grant

A special [private entry](#private-entry) that an [agent](#agent) writes to their [source chain](#source-chain) to record the issuing of a capability and its terms, including the intended [subject](#capability-subject). The address of this grant becomes a [capability token](#capability-token).

#### Capability claim

A special [source chain entry](#source-chain-entry) that a [subject](#capability-subject) writes to their [source chain](#source-chain). It records the [token](#capability-token) that they received, allowing them to exercise their capability later.

#### Capability subject

The entity that is given permission to access a resource via [capability-based security](#capability-based-security). In Holochain, this can be a client or bridged DNA instance on the same machine, or it can be another agent who exercises a capability by communicating with the grantor via [node-to-node messaging](#node-to-node-messaging).

#### Capability token

A proof that a [subject](#capability-subject) has been given a capability. It's synonymous with the ability to exercise that capability.

#### Centralization

The degree to which [agency](#agency), decision-making power, or responsibility in a [distributed system](#distributed-system) is concentrated in certain nodes. [Client/server](#client-server) systems are highly centralized. The complement of centralization is, of course, [decentralization](#decentralization).

#### Client

Any piece of software that accesses a [DNA instance](#dna-instance)'s [zome functions](#zome-function). It makes function calls over the [conductor](#conductor)'s [RPC interface](#rpc-interface). This client can be a [GUI](#graphical-user-interface-gui), a shell script, a service, or a scheduled task. This client lives on the same machine as the [conductor](#conductor).

#### Client/server

A highly [centralized](#centralization) [distributed system](#distributed-system) architecture in which certain nodes are responsible for most of the processing, storage, and decision-making. Client/server systems typically give low [agency](#agency) to end-users.

#### Commit

The act of adding an [entry](#entry) to a [source chain](#source-chain). If an entry is a [public entry](#public-entry) it also gets [published](#publish) to the DHT.

#### Commons

Any resource that is used by a group of agents but owned by none. In order to survive, a commons must have rules governing its use. A Holochain [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht) is a type of digital commons whose rules are enforced by its [DNA](#dna).

#### Conductor

The service that hosts all of a participant's [DNA instances](#dna-instance), storing data and connecting them to others in the network. Synonymous with a Holochain [node](#node).

#### Conductor API

The [RPC interface](#rpc-interface) that a [conductor](#conductor) exposes, which allows locally running [clients](#client) to access and manipulate configuration of [DNAs](#dna), [agents](#agent), [instances](#dna-instance), and [RPC interfaces](#rpc-interface)

#### Conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT)

A function that allows two [nodes](#node) in a [distributed system](#distributed-system) to separately make changes to the same piece of data without creating conflicts. A CRDT is [logically monotonic](#logical-monotonicity), which means that it satisfies the [CALM theorem](#consistency-as-logical-monotonicity-calm-theorem) and doesn't need a [coordination protocol](#coordination-protocol).

#### Consensus

1. Synonymous with [consistency](#consistency) in a [distributed system](#distributed-system).

2. Synonymous with [global consensus](#global-consensus) in a [blockchain](#blockchain) or other [DLT](#distributed-ledger-technology-dlt).

#### Consistency

Agreement among [nodes](#node) in a [distributed system](#distributed-system) about the state of data. [Blockchains](#blockchain) enforce a strong form of consistency called [global consensus](#global-consensus). Holochain prefers small-scale consensus, either between interacting parties or among a small set of third-party [validators](#validator).

#### Consistency/availability/partition-tolerance (CAP) theorem

A principle that states that all [distributed systems](#distributed-system) are prone to 'partitions' (some groups of nodes becoming unavailable to each other), and that in the presence of a partition a design can only guarantee availability (data can always be accessed and written) or [consistency](#consistency) (data is always correct), but not both.

#### Consistency as logical monotonicity (CALM) theorem

A principle that states that, as long as a function is [logically monotonic](#logical-monotonicity), it can be run on multiple [nodes](#node) in a [distributed system](#distributed-system) and reach strong [eventual consistency](#eventual-consistency) without needing [coordination protocols](#coordination-protocol).

#### Content-addressable store (CAS)

Any storage system that gives a unique ID to each piece of data and allows it to be retrieved by its ID rather than its physical location. A [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht) is a type of CAS.

#### Coordination protocol

An algorithm that governs the synchronization of data in a [distributed system](#distributed-system). It aims to prevent or resolve data conflicts that happen when two [nodes](#node) are out of sync with each other. Any [state transition](#state-transition) that isn't [logically monotonic](#logical-monotonicity) needs a coordination protocol.

#### Core API

See [Holochain Core API](#holochain-core-api).

#### Create, read, update, delete (CRUD)

The four main things an application needs to do with data. Even though all data structures in Holochain are [append-only](#append-only), data can still be updated or deleted by adding a new entry that marks the old data as obsolete.

#### Decentralization

The act of removing central points of control. Many [distributed systems](#distributed-system) are decentralized to various degrees.

#### Deduplication

The removal of identical entries in a [CAS](#content-addressable-store-cas). Most CASes, including Holochain's [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht), deduplicate content automatically.

#### DeepKey

Holochain's standard [DPKI](#distributed-public-key-infrastructure-dpki) library.

#### DHT entry

A public [entry](#entry) that lives in the [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht). DHT entries are assigned to a [neighborhood](#neighborhood) of [validators](#validator), are [deduplicated](#deduplication), can have many authors, and have [metadata](#metadata) attached to them in [aspects](#aspect).

#### Distributed hash table (DHT)

A collection of data stored collectively by many [nodes](#node) in a [distributed system](#distributed-system). A node retrieves data by address (usually its cryptographic [hash](#hash)), searching for a [peer](#peer) that is responsible for holding the data. Holochain uses a [validating DHT](#validating-dht) to store [public entries](#public-entry). Each [DNA](#dna) has its own separate DHT.

#### Distributed ledger technology (DLT)

Any technology that involves many [nodes](#node) in a distributed system sharing an [append-only](#append-only) history of [state transitions](#state-transition). In Holochain, each [agent](#agent) stores their own history in their [source chain](#source-chain) and shares copies of it with [peers](#peer).

#### Distributed public key infrastructure (DPKI)

A [public key infrastructure](#public-key-infrastructure-pki) that doesn't rely on a central authority. [DeepKey](#deepkey) is Holochain's default DPKI implementation.

#### Distributed system

Any system that involves multiple [nodes](#node) talking to each other over a network, whether [decentralized](#decentralization) or [centralized](#centralization). Because communication isn't instantaneous, different nodes can create conflicting data. Many distributed systems use a [coordination protocol](#coordination-protocol) to come to [consistency](#consistency), while others rely on the [CALM theorem](#consistency-as-logical-monotonicity-calm-theorem).

#### DNA

A [package](#package) of executable code that defines the shared 'rules of the game' for a group of agents. A DNA is made up of [zomes](#zome), which define [validation rules](#validation-rule) for data and [zome functions](#zome-function) for agents to take action.

#### DNA instance

A particular Holochain [DNA](#dna) when it's bound to an [agent](#agent). DNA + agent = instance.

#### End-to-end encryption (E2EE)

A channel between two nodes in a public network that allows them to transfer secret messages that cannot be decrypted by eavesdroppers. Holochain's [node-to-node messaging](#node-to-node-messaging) uses E2EE, as does [gossip](#gossip) between nodes.

#### Entry

A basic unit of data in a Holochain app. Each entry has its own defined [entry type](#entry-type). When an agent [commits](#commit) an entry, it is written to their [source chain](#source-chain). If it's marked as a [public entry](#public-entry), it's also [published](#publish) to the DHT.

#### Entry type

A specific sort of entry that a [DNA](#dna) recognizes and understands. Like an <abbr title="object-oriented programming">OOP</abbr> class or database table, its [entries](#entry) have an enforced data schema and [validation rules](#validation-rule). Its entries can also be [public](#public-entry) or [private](#private-entry).

#### Eventual consistency

Describes a promise made by distributed systems that optimize for availability over consistency (see [CAP theorem](#consistency-availability-partition-tolerance-cap-theorem)), meaning that given enough time, every [node](#node) ought to eventually reach [consistency](#consistency) with each other. _Strong_ eventual consistency means nodes are _guaranteed_ to reach consistency without conflicts, which is possible for any system whose [state transition](#state-transition) functions adhere to the [CALM theorem](#consistency-as-logical-monotonicity-calm-theorem).

#### Front end

Synonymous with [graphical user interface](#graphical-user-interface-gui).

#### Global ledger

A [ledger](#ledger) whose contents are identical across all [nodes](#node) in a [blockchain](#blockchain).

#### Gossip

A protocol used by many [peer-to-peer networks](#peer-to-peer-network). Each [node](#node) knows a few other nodes, who know a few more, and so forth. Whenever any node receives a message, they broadcast it to some or all of their peers. Data propagates slowly at first, but spreads at an exponential rate. Nodes in a Holochain [network](#network) share entries, metadata, [neighborhood](#neighborhood) health, and peer addresses via gossip.

#### Graphical user interface (GUI)

A [client](#client) that presents a visual, easy-to-understand way for a user to interact with a [DNA instance](#dna-instance) or collection of instances running in their [conductor](#conductor). As with any client, the GUI always runs on the same machine as the conductor.

#### hApp bundle

A package containing multiple DNA packages that are instantiated together to form the [back end](#back-end) for a [hApp](#holochain-application-happ), along with a UI package for the [front end](#front-end). [Holoscape](#holoscape) can install and run fully function [applications](#application) from hApp bundles.

#### Hash

A unique 'fingerprint' for a piece of data, calculated by running the data through a special function. A hash can serve as a unique identifier for that data (such as with [addresses](#address) of [DHT entries](#dht-entry)) and makes it easy to retrieve data from a hash table and verify its integrity.

#### Hash chain

An [append-only](#append-only) data structure that can be used as a tamper-evident sequential log of events, such as a [source chain](#source-chain) or [blockchain](#blockchain).

#### History

The entries committed by an [agent](#agent), recorded in their [source chain](#source-chain).

#### Holo

1. The company funding development of [Holochain Core](#holochain-core).

2. See [Holo Host](#holo-host).

#### Holochain Development Kit (HDK)

Holochain's standard software development kit (SDK) for [zome](#zome) and [DNA](#dna) developers. It proides developer-friendly access to the low-level [Holochain core API](#holochain-core-api) as well as macros for defining [entry](#entry) and [link](#link) types,[validation functions](#validation-function), and [init functions](#init-function).

#### Holochain application (hApp)

A collection of [DNAs](#dna) and a [client](#client) (or clients) that allow users to interact with those DNAs. Typically distributed as a [hApp bundle](#happ-bundle)

#### Holochain Core

The basic components of Holochain. The [conductor](#conductor), the [nucleus](#nucleus), and the [ribosome](#ribosome).

#### Holochain Core API

The set of core functions that the [nucleus](#nucleus) makes available to the [ribosome](#ribosome), so the [ribosome](#ribosome) can make them available to a running [DNA instance](#dna-instance). These functions allow the DNA to access and manipulate an [agent](#agent)'s [source chain](#source-chain), run cryptographic functions, retrieve and write [DHT entries](#dht-entry) and [links](#link), and send [node-to-node messages](#node-to-node-message) to [peers](#peer).

#### Holo Host

A platform and marketplace where Holochain users offer up their spare computing capacity for a fee. Read more at [Holo's website](https://holo.host/host/).

#### Immune system

A property of Holochain's [validating DHT](#validating-dht), whereby healthy [nodes](#node) detect invalid data, share proof of corruption among their peers, and take defensive action against the corrupt nodes that produced it. While each node is individually responsible for taking action, the cumulative effect is a collective rejection of the corrupt nodes.

#### Init callback

A function in a [DNA](#dna) that the [nucleus](#nucleus) calls when an [agent](#agent) runs the [DNA instance](#dna-instance) for the first time. This can be used to set up initial variables, etc.

#### Intrinsic data integrity

Holochain's fundamental strategy for guaranteeing data integrity. Data is considered valid or invalid based on the [DNA](#dna)'s [validation rules](#validation-rule) as well as Holochain's [subconscious](#subconscious) validation rules.

#### Journal

Synonymous with [ledger](#ledger).

#### Ledger

A history of events or [state transitions](#state-transition). In [distributed ledger technology](#distributed-ledger-technology-dlt), ledgers are usually stored as [hash chains](#hash-chain), such as a Holochain agent's [source chain](#source-chain).

#### Link

A piece of [metadata](#metadata) connecting one [DHT entry](#dht-entry) to another. Each link has a defined type as well as a 'tag' for storing arbitrary content.

#### Logical monotonicity

Describes a set of facts in which the truth of prior facts are never negated by the addition of later facts. [CALM](#consistency-as-logical-monotonicity-calm) relies on functions that exhibit this property---that is, [monotonically increasing functions](#monotonically-increasing-function).

#### Membrane

A permeable boundary in a Holochain app that allows appropriate access and disallows inappropriate access, specifically:

1. The layer of protection around an [agent](#agent)'s [DNA instance](#dna-instance) (provided by [capability-based security](#capability-based-security)) that prevents unauthorized access to the instance or its source chain data.

2. A special [validation rule](#validation-rule) for the [agent ID](#agent-id) entry that governs the [agent](#agent)'s ability to become part of the [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht).

#### Metadata

Supplementary data attached to a piece of data. In a Holochain [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht), metadata such as [links](#link) are stored on [entries](#entry) as [aspects](#aspect).

#### Microservice

An application architecture pattern that encourages small, single-purpose [back end](#back-end) services. Holochain [DNAs](#dna) can be designed as microservices that combine to form a fully featured [hApp](#holochain-application-happ).

#### Monotonically increasing function

A function in which adding things to the input can only increase the output, preserving [logical monotonicity](#logical-monotonicity) and allowing the elimination of [coordination](#coordination) protocols in a [distributed system](#distributed-system) by virtue of the [CALM theorem](#consistency-as-logical-monotonicity-calm-theorem). This might seem a bit abstract, so consider an example: the [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht) never retracts entries; it only adds new ones. Even a deletion is merely the addition of a new entry that says "please consider the old entry obsolete".

#### Mutual sovereignty

The interplay between the autonomy of the individual and the collective intentions of the group. A successful [commons](#commons) finds a healthy balance between these opposites. Holochain's design is based on this principle, empowering [participants](#participant) to control their own identity and their response to their peers by equipping each of them with a full copy of the application. But those same rules embedded in the application also constitute the group's intentions, so the choice to use a particular also constitutes a participant's consent to help uphold the group.

#### Nearness

The proximity of two [addresses](#address) to each other in the [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht)'s [address space](#address-space), expressed as the XOR distance between them.

#### Neighborhood

A group of [nodes](#node) in a Holochain [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht) who are [near](#nearness) to each other (in terms of [address space](#address-space), not geography). Neighbors collectively support the [resilience](#resilience) of all [DHT entries](#dht-entry) whose [address](#address) is near to them by storing and [validating](#validator) those entries and [gossiping](#gossip) to each other about the entries they have.

#### Network

A community of [nodes](#node) [gossiping](#gossip) with each other to form a [validating DHT](#validating-dht), aiding in data storage and retrieval, validation, and peer discovery. Each [DNA](#dna) has a separate network.

#### Node

An individual [agent](#agent) in a Holochain [network](#network). It has an [agent address](#agent-address) and can be talked to via [gossip](#gossip).

#### Node-to-node message

A direct, [end-to-end-encrypted](#end-to-end-encryption) exchange between two [nodes](#node) on a [network](#network).

#### Nucleus

The core of Holochain. It governs data flow between the [conductor](#conductor) and a [DNA instance](#dna-instance), with the help of the [ribosome](#ribosome), and enforces the [subconscious](#subconscious) [validation rules](#validation-rule).

#### Package

1. Synonymous with [DNA](#dna).

2. The act of compiling [zome](#zome) source code and configuration data into a [DNA](#dna) package.

#### Participant

Synonymous with 'user'. We often prefer the term 'participant' because a Holochain [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht) is a [commons](#commons) of [mutually sovereign](#mutual-sovereignty) peers who all actively participate to maintain its integrity.

#### Peer

Synonymous with [node](#node).

#### Peer-to-peer

Describes a highly [decentralized](#decentralization) [distributed system](#distributed-system) in which [nodes](#node) talk directly to each other without the intermediation of a [server](#client-server) or other [central](#centralization) nodes.

#### Private entry

An [entry](#entry) which is stored on the [source chain](#source-chain) but not [published](#publish) to the [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht).

#### Provenance

A [public key](#public-key-cryptography) and a [public-key signature](#public-key-signature), stored as a piece of metadata on a [DHT entry](#dht-entry). It proves that an [agent](#agent) (represented by the public key) actually authored the entry (as proven by the signature), and also allows anyone to verify that a third party hasn't tampered with it.

#### Public entry

Synonymous with [DHT entry](#dht-entry). Any entry marked public will be [published](#publish) to the [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht).

#### Public-key cryptography

A cryptographic system that consists of two keys: a public component and a private or secret component. These keys are mathematically related to each other in a way that's easy for the key pair's owner to prove but nearly impossible for a third-party to reverse-engineer. In Holochain, the public key lives in the [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht) as an [agent](#agent)'s identity and the private key stays on the agent's device as a proof that they control their public key. [Peers](#peer) can verify an agent's claim of authorship on an entry by checking their [provenance](#provenance), or can use an agent's public key to encrypt a private message that only they can decrypt.

#### Public-key infrastructure (PKI)

A way for agents to share their public keys, prove their authenticity, and revoke old keys if they've been compromised. Most PKIs, such as the global SSL certficate authority system, are centralized. Holochain provides a [distributed PKI](#distributed-public-key-infrastructure-dpki) system.

#### Public-key signature

The hash of a piece of data, encrypted with a private key. It can be decrypted by anyone who has a copy of the public key. In Holochain, this is used in a [provenance](#provenance) on each [DHT entry](#dht-entry) to prove authorship and detect third-party tampering.

#### Public/private key pair

See [public-key cryptography](#public-key-cryptography).

#### Publish

To send a [public entry](#public-entry) to the [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht) after it has passed the author's own copy of the [validation rules](#validation-rule) for the entry. The [neighborhood](#neighborhood) of [validators](#validator) who are responsible for that entry's [address](#address) receive it, validate it, and store a copy of it if it's valid.

#### Remote procedure call (RPC)

In Holochain, a call that a [client](#client) makes to a [zome function](#zome-function) or [conductor API](#conductor-api) function over an RPC interace.

#### RPC interface

A network port that the [conductor](#conductor) exposes, allowing [clients](#client) to call the [conductor API](#conductor-api) or make [zome function calls](#zome-function-call) to running [DNA instances](#dna-instance). This interface only listens for local connections (so it can't be accessed over the internet). That means that clients must be on the same machine as the conductor.

#### Resilience

The level of a [network](#network)'s capacity to hold itself and its data in integrity as [nodes](#node) leave and join the network and dishonest nodes try to corrupt it.

#### Resilience factor

The desired number of copies of a [DHT entry](#dht-entry) that should exist in a [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht). This value is set in the [DNA](#dna) by its creator. [Nodes](#node) in a [neighborhood](#neighborhood) who are responsible for an entry collectively work to make sure this factor is met at all times. That is, for a resilience factor of 5, each entry is expected to exist on five nodes with 100% uptime or ten nodes with 50% uptime. If an entry has reached [saturation](#saturation), it's met the resilience factor.

#### Ribosome

The 'sandbox' or 'virtual machine' inside which a [DNA instance](#dna-instance) runs. In Holochain's current design, the ribosome is a [WebAssembly](#webassembly-wasm) interpreter that exposes Holochain's [core API](#holochain-core-api) to the instance and allows the [nucleus](#nucleus) to call the instance's [validation functions](#validation-function), [init function](#init-function), and other callbacks.

#### Rust

The programming language used to build both Holochain and [DNAs](#dna).

#### Saturation

The state at which the peers holding a [DHT entry](#dht-entry) have satisfied the [DNA](#dna)'s expected [resilience factor](#resilience-factor).

#### Scenario test

An automated test involving multiple [agents](#agent) on a simulated [network](#network). [DNA](#dna) creators can write these tests to ensure that their code works properly in real-life scenarios.

#### Sharding

The process of reducing the processing and storage load on individual [nodes](#node) in a [distributed system](#distributed-system). While some sharded systems break data into discrete shards, Holochain's [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht) shards nodes into overlapping [neighborhoods](#neighborhood). This increases

#### Signal

A message emitted by a DNA, meant to be received and responded to a [client](#client)

#### Source chain

A [hash chain](#hash-chain) of actions taken by an [agent](#agent). For each [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht), every agent stores their own source chain as a record of [state transitions](#state-transition) they've made---that is, [entries](#entry) they've committed.

#### Source chain entry

An individual record stored on a [source chain](#source-chain). It may be a [private entry](#private-entry), in which case it lives only on the source chain, or it may be a [public entry](#public-entry), in which case it's also [published](#publish) to the [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht).

#### Source chain header

A meta-entry that links a [source chain entry](#source-chain-entry) to the previous entry in an [agent](#agent)'s [source chain](#source-chain).

#### State transition

A modification of application state. In Holochain, state transitions begin life in an [agent](#agent)'s [source chain](#source-chain) as [entries](#entry) and are optionally [published](#publish) to the [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht) as a permanent public record.

#### Subconscious

The 'base' [validation rules](#validation-rule) defined by the Holochain [nucleus](#nucleus). These rules check validity of [hashes](#hash) and [provenances](#provenance), as well as the integrity of each [agent](#agent)'s source chain.

#### Trustless

Describes a [peer-to-peer](#peer-to-peer) [distributed system](#distributed-system) which is [Byzantine fault tolerant](#byzantine-fault-tolerance) even when [nodes](#node) are anonymous and membership is unrestricted. Trust is placed in the algorithm, rather than in the reputation of the actors.

#### Validating DHT

Holochain's [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht) design that creates an [immune system](#immune-system) for the group. [Validators](#validator) are chosen at random, based on their [nearness](#nearness) to the [address](#address) of the [entry](#entry) to be validated. If an entry fails validation, the validator publishes a [warrant](#warrant) against the entry's author, along with proof of invalidity.

#### Validation rule

A function that checks the correctness of an [entry](#entry). If validation fails, a [validator](#validator) can publish a [warrant](#warrant) proving that the entry's author has broken the 'rules of the game' in the [DNA](#dna)'s executable code.

#### Validation signature

A [provenance](#provenance) created by the [validator](#validator) of a [DHT entry](#dht-entry), attesting to the validity of that entry according to its [validation rule](#validation-rule).

#### Validator

A [node](#node) in the [validating DHT](#validating-dht) who is chosen at random to validate a [DHT entry](#dht-entry), based on their [agent address](#agent-address)' [nearness](#nearness) to the address of the entry. After validating, they also store the entry and help maintain its [resilience](#resilience).

#### Warrant

An entry created by the [validator](#validator) of a [DHT entry](#dht-entry), attesting that the entry is invalid according to its [validation rule](#validation-rule) and proving that its author has broken the 'rules of the game' in the [DNA](#dna)'s executable code.

#### WebAssembly (WASM)

A low-level byte code that can be run on almost any platform, including the web browser. Holochain expects [DNAs](#dna) to be compiled to WebAssembly so the [ribosome](#ribosome) can execute them.

#### XOR distance

A metric used to calculate the distance between two [addresses](#address) in the [DHT](#distributed-hash-table-dht)'s [address space](#address-space). The addresses' binary representations are XORed together, and the resulting value is turned into an integer. This distance is used for determining a node's neighborhood, including entries they are responsible for and nodes they are neighbors with.

#### Zome

A basic unit of modularity inside a [DNA](#dna). Zome can be mixed and matched from other DNAs into one DNA in the service of the needs of a [network](#network). This zome defines [entry](#entry) types, [link](#link) types, validation functions, public [zome functions](#zome-function), and [init functions](#init-function).

#### Zome function

A function, created by the author of a [zome](#zome), that allows a [client](#client) to take a particular action in a [DNA instance](#dna-instance). This includes data retrieval and storage, as well as node-to-node messaging. The zome functions act as a public API for the [zome](#zome), and can be called by another zome within the same [DNA](#dna), a [bridged](#bridge) DNA instance within the same [conductor](#conductor), or a [client](#client) via the conductor's [RPC interface](#rpc-interface).

#### Zome function call

The act of calling a [zome function](#zome-function).
